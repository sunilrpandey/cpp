Design notes
Steps
1. Gather all possible use cases
2. constraints and Analysis
3. High level Design : Most basic, few use cases
4. find bottleneck and solve them
5. Scalability : A large number of users, loop through 4 & 5 till we get a satisfactroy anser

Pattern in real life
composite - family tree, filesystem
Observer - mail post
Factory/Abstract Factory : Door purchase
Adaptor - power adapter
Facade - event management

Builder - meal order in restaurant

Design LRU Cache
1. use fixed cache size size std::list for cache
2. Have hashmap to see if page is there in list.. we having map<pageno(int), list::iter> for this
3. if list is full remove a page at rear
3. check page(int) in hashmap if there, erase it, push this to front as it will be most recent entry and add this entry to hashmap, if not there add at the begining

Design Issues
Solid Principles
 - 
 
 Fake - A module which returns some output instead of running that moudle porperly
 Stub - which is based on some mock framework which ARRANGE to configure to return some value, 
 Mock - Adding functionality to Stub it makes sure how many times this function need to be called.

 Agile Requirements Modeling

  Test Driven Development is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring
  One view is the goal of TDD is specification and not validation (Martin, Newkirk, and Kess 2003).  In other words, itâ€™s one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code (implying that TDD is both an important agile requirements and agile design technique). Another view is that TDD is a programming technique.  As Ron Jeffries likes to say, the goal of TDD is to write clean code that works
